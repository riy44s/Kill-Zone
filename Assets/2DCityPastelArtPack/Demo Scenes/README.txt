Sorting Layers:
When I exported the Demo scenes all the sorting layers broke. There is no fix to this as of this writing 3/11/16 Hopefully Unity will fix this soon. My fix was to go through the whole seen and change the "order in layer" number to make the scene work correctly. But when you build your games I do not recommend duplicating this technique. Sorting layers are a great tool.
